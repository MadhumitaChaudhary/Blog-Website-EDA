# Blog Website Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of content from a Blog Website 'ABC Times'. The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Feature Creation (Revenue calculation and analysis)
- Content performance scoring and categorization
-  WIP

## Data

The data used in this project is from ABC Times (Simulated Data Representation). It includes information about the content category, date, content performance score, and various revenue sources.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and data errors.
2. Feature Extraction: Extracting year and month from the date column.
3. Univariate Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of individual variables.
4. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between different variables.
5. Revenue Calculation: Calculating total and average revenue.
6. Content Performance Scoring: Categorizing content performance into 'Poor', 'Average', 'Good', and 'Excellent'.

Future work includes more detailed analysis and the use of machine learning models for prediction and classification tasks. The project is still WIP
